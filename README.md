# Data Dictionary

The Data Dictionary of the NIH HEAL (Help Ending Addiction Long-term) Platform (https://healdata.org/dd) provides the first level of validation for all data stored on the HEAL Platform and generated by the HEAL Working Groups.

Written in YAML, the JSON schemas define all the individual entities (nodes) in the data model and define all of the relationships (links) between the nodes. These schemas define the valid key-value pairs that can be used to describe the nodes.
